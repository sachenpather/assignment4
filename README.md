## Description
The contents of this repository includes 2 mips assembly language programs for processing images by manipulating their respective ppm files. 
The programs read an input image file, manipulate the pixel values, and save the modified image as an output file

## question 1: increase_brightness

### Description:
- File: increase_brightness.asm
- This program reads an input PPM image file, increases each pixel value by 10 with a max limit at 255 to brighten the pixels

### How to Use:
1. The program was tested on QTSpim
2. Open the code for the files and edit the input and output filepaths, ensure the output file is a blank .ppm file
   - Input Filename: Edit the input variable as explained in the comments for the programs to the absolute path of your input image file.
   - Output Filename: Edit the output variable as explained in the comments for the programs to the absolute path of your input image file.
3. Run the program on QTSpim

## Program 2: greyscale

### Description:
- File: greyscale.asm
- This program reads an input PPM image file and converts it to be read as a greyscale file to convert the image from being on rgb scale to black white (grey) scale

### How to Use:
2. Open the code for the files and edit the input and output filepaths, ensure the output file is a blank .ppm file
   - Input Filename: Edit the input variable as explained in the comments for the programs to the absolute path of your input image file.
   - Output Filename: Edit the output variable as explained in the comments for the programs to the absolute path of your input image file.
3. Run the program on QTSpim
